# My First project

This project is based on the first project in the famous book : *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition* by *Aurélien Géron* [link to the Github project](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2)

This project allows me to do my first end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) project. 

You can find all the data used for the project in the folder [datasets/housing](https://github.com/BenDamour/Portfolio/tree/master/Tutorials/datasets/housing). 
The project's code is in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook called **_Housing_Corporation.ipynb_**.

## Goal of the project

The main goal of this project is to build a model than could help us to make prediction about the housing prices in California (based on data from the 1990 California Census).
