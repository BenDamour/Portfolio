# This folder contains all my Machine Learning projects.

1. ## California Housing Project
   

This project is based on the first project in the famous book : *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition* by *Aurélien Géron* [link to the Github project](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2)

This project allows me to do my first end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) project. 

You can find all the data used for the project in the folder [datasets/housing](https://github.com/BenDamour/Portfolio/tree/master/Machine_Learning/datasets/housing). 
The project's code is in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook called [California Housing Project](https://github.com/BenDamour/Portfolio/tree/master/Machine_Learning/California_Housing_Project.ipynb).

   - ### Goal of the project

The main goal of this project is to build a model than could help us to make prediction about the housing prices in California (based on data from the 1990 California Census). 

2. ## IRIS project
   

This project allows me to test some classification models on the IRIS dataset. 

The project's code is in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook called [Iris Project](https://github.com/BenDamour/Portfolio/tree/master/Machine_Learning/Iris_Project.ipynb).

   - ### Goal of the project

The main goal of this project is to predict the class of an iris flower (i.e. Setosa, Virginica, Versicolor) when we have som of them characteristics (petal length, petal width OR sepal length, sepal width).

3. ## MNIST project
   

This project allows me to test some classification models on the MNIST dataset. 

The project's code is in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook called [MNIST Project](https://github.com/BenDamour/Portfolio/tree/master/Machine_Learning/MNIST_Project.ipynb).

   - ### Goal of the project

The main goal of this project is to predict the class of a handwriting digit (i.e. 0-9) when we take a look of the picture of the handwriting digits.

3. ## Moons project
   

This project allows me to test some classification models on the Moons dataset (a toy set). 

The project's code is in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook called [Moons Project](https://github.com/BenDamour/Portfolio/tree/master/Machine_Learning/Moons_Project.ipynb).

   - ### Goal of the project

The main goal of this project is to predict the class of an element (i.e. 0 or 1) in a array of elements. The particularity of this dataset, is the fact that all the elements produce two half moon's (I would say like a Yin et yang moon).
